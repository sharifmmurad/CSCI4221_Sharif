### Title  
**Link Budget to Semester Expenses**

### User Story  
_As a college student, I want to link my budget to semester expenses like books, tuition, and clubs so I can see how each event impacts my spending._

---

### Business Value  
Gives student users a clear view of academic spending that affects their monthly and semester budgets, supporting smarter decisions and financial awareness.

### Acceptance Criteria  
1. From the home screen, the user can tap **Budget → Add Semester Expense** and enter amount, category, and date.  
2. Categories include **Tuition, Books, Supplies, Clubs**, and **Custom**.  
3. The semester view shows totals by category and overall semester total.  
4. Each new expense instantly updates monthly and semester totals.  
5. Data persists across app restarts using local storage.  
6. Two working clicks on the home screen are present (**Budget** and **Add Semester Expense**).  
7. The prototype from Project 2 appears when `index.tsx` under `/app/tab` loads.
