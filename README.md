# Product Vision Statement

> Our goal is to create a smart, reactive calendar application that helps users organize events, manage budgets, and receive timely reminders without clutter or confusion. By integrating budgeting with scheduling, the app provides a single, clear view of time and money — making everyday planning effortless and efficient.




# Meeting Summary

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Attendees:** Cameron Brown, Sharif Muhammad, Griffin Sanders

## Discussion Points
1. **Drafted the product vision statement** for our *Calendar and Budget Management App*.
2. **Reviewed and agreed on the PBI & Sprint Table.**
3. **Identified and discussed three main issues:**
   - **Overlapping Tasks and Calendar Conflicts** — Users can schedule multiple events simultaneously without warnings. We'll add a conflict-detection feature.
   - **Notification Overload or Missed Reminders** — Need smarter notification frequency controls.
   - **Poor User Engagement / Task Abandonment** — Simplify the interface to keep it clean and intuitive.
4. **Selected a feature to prototype:** calendar and email notification system.
5. **Planned** to make the calendar reactive and allow users to add budgets directly to scheduled events.
6. **Discussed use cases,** such as a *student managing class schedules and expenses*.

### Description
This prototype shows the **Notification Settings** interface for the Calendar and Budget Management App.  
Users can toggle task reminders, email digests, push alerts, and calendar notifications.  
It also allows users to set **Quiet Hours** to pause alerts during specific times, helping prevent overload and keeping reminders focused and relevant.


# User Story – Calendar and Budget Sync

**As a** college student,  
**I want** to link my class schedule to my budget,  
**so that** I can see how upcoming academic expenses (books, tuition, club fees) affect my weekly spending.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The user can tag calendar events with expense categories.  
- The app automatically updates total spending and provides a summary view.  
- Notifications alert the user when an event has a related cost or due date.
